					<p>My earliest exposure to computers came in the early 80's. My mom, being tired of having me around the house all day, sent me to summer day camp at Maryville College (Now University) to learn computer programming. With help from instructors, we learned a few commands in "basic". Over the years, we had access to early model personal computers such as the Texas Instruments TI100, and the Radio Shack Tandy T1000, and in my freshman year of high school, the Apple 2. However, I never took computers as anything more than work processors until I bought my first Windows 95 computer in 1995. This was my introduction to the true internet, and I was mesmerized by the possibilities. I taught myself basic html and made a few very basic web pages for friends and small businesses. However, my true love had always been photography, and I choose to pursue that career rather than coding, which at that point was only a distraction.<br>In 2001, the end of film photography was well within sight. In an attempt to stay relevent in the photographic processing industry, I went to school for computer networking and earned my MCP Certification. However, by 2004, no amount of preparation on my part was going to to ward of the impending dominance of digital photography. Out of work, I turned back to my early experiences with computers and took a job programming and operating industrial lasers in a medical manufacturing plant. After 9 years of a spotless work record with perfect attendance, the direction of the company changed in a way that I could not follow. My boss may have been able to accept a lower quality of product, but my personal standards were higher than that. I guess I refused to sign off on substandard brain surgery instruments one too many times, and found myself job hunting yet again.<br>I was lucky. A woman at the Emplyment Office had heard of Launchcode and RebootU. I applied and was accepted to a 20 week coding bootcamp, which I completed at the end of June, 2015. This intense learning class used the Harvard CS50 online class as a jump off point, then expanded upon that knowledge to teach us advanced skills. After CS50, we were offered 2 tracks. Many of us chose to concentrate on Java programming. I, along with several others, chose the web track, learning HTML, CSS, PHP, and Javascript. I really enjoy the ability to take an idea and turn it into something that people around the world can see just hours or even minutes later.</p>

					<p>So, that's my story about my life around computers. But, computers do not define me. I have many hobbies as well. My love is mountain biking. I own a couple of high end mountain bikes, and ride whenever I can. I've been lucky enough to go downhill riding in Colorado and am looking forward to going back there and maybe doing some desert riding in Utah and New Mexico. I also enjoy softball. I've had to sit out a couple of years due to a shoulder injury, but I still have all of my equipment and will be getting back to it probably next season. Since I have discovered that not all trails are able to be ridden on a bike, I've taken up some hiking to allow me to see more trails and nature, including climbing some waterfalls. Most recently, I've started trap shooting. I was horrible when I first tried it, and am still pretty bad, but I have found it to be one of my favorite activities. </p>
